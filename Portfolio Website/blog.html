            <h2>What I Learned from Building My First Website</h2>
            <p><em>Posted on July 5, 2025</em></p>
            <p>
                When I built my first website using only HTML, I realized how important structure and semantics are. I
                used tags like
                <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> to give it
                meaning.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Don't chase perfection in the beginning — chase completion."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                I struggled a bit with nesting and closing tags correctly, but that made me appreciate the foundation of
                every webpage.
                <strong>Consistency and clarity</strong> made my website feel professional, even though it was very
                basic.

            <h2>How I Designed My Favorite Contents Page</h2>
            <p><em>Posted on July 7, 2025</em></p>
            <p>
                I wanted to create a page that reflects my taste in anime, movies, and series. Using simple HTML lists
                and proper headings,
                I was able to build a clean and organized layout. I grouped them into sections like "Masterpiece Anime",
                "Philosophical Films",
                and "TV Shows That Changed Me".
            </p>
            <p>
                I also used `<strong>` and `<em>` tags to emphasize my top picks like <em>Attack on Titan</em> and
                        <strong>Dark</strong>.
                        Even though I didn't use CSS, the structure was neat and easy to follow.

            <h2>Why HTML Is the Best Place to Start</h2>
            <p><em>Posted on July 8, 2025</em></p>
            <p>
                Many beginners rush into JavaScript or frameworks, but I believe learning HTML first gives you a solid
                foundation. It's like
                learning the grammar of a language before writing poetry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once I understood tags, nesting, and semantic structure, I could build any layout I imagined — without
                being distracted by styling.
                If you're new to web development, <strong>start with HTML</strong>. It builds your confidence and gives
                immediate results.

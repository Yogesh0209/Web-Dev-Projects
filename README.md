###  About Me
-  Currently learning: **HTML** (mastering every single tag like a perfectionist )
-  Next on the list: **CSS** & **JavaScript** (coming soon to a browser near you )
-  Project motto: “Small but solid — I’d rather build a basic spaceship than crash a fancy one 🚀💥”
-  Fun fact: I talk to my code like it’s a person. Sometimes, it even listens

Some quotes I like * made...
“Code like nobody's watching, commit like everyone is.”
“If it works — ship it. If it breaks — explain it was a feature.”

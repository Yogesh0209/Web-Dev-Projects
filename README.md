###  About Me
-  Currently learning: **HTML** (mastering every single tag like a perfectionist )
-  Next on the list: **CSS** & **JavaScript** (coming soon to a browser near you )
-  Project motto: “Small but solid — I’d rather build a basic spaceship than crash a fancy one ”
-  Fun fact: I talk to my code like it’s a person. Sometimes, it even listens

###  My Beginner Projects

Here are my humble beginnings — the pixel-sized bricks of my future empire:

|  Project |  Live Demo |  Code |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
|  **Profile Page** | *Deployed* | [GitHub](#) |
|  **Bookmark Manager** | *Up & Running* | [GitHub](#) |
|  **Wallpaper Showcase** | *Live Now* | [GitHub](#) |
|  **College Registration Form** | *Ready to use* | [GitHub](#) |

> _Yes, they’re simple — but I made every `<div>` with love and every `<label>` with care._

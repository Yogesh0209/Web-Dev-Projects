## About Me

- 🎯 Currently learning: **HTML** (mastering every single tag like a perfectionist)
- ⏭️ Next on the list: **CSS** & **JavaScript** (coming soon to a browser near you)
- 🚀 Motto: “Small but solid — I’d rather build a basic spaceship than crash a fancy one”
- 🤖 Fun fact: I talk to my code like it’s a person. Sometimes, it even listens
